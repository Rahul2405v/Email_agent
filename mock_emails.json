    "body_text": "Hi Alex,\n\nI've reviewed the latest logs from the nightly build, and there's something we need to address immediately. Although the accuracy improved by roughly 2% after the latest model tweaks, the latency has gone up significantly on the inference cluster. The increase appears to be consistent across GPU nodes and edge deployments.\n\nPlease inspect the feature extraction pipeline added in Build 2047. Early signs suggest the new attention fusion layer may be causing longer compute cycles. We cannot proceed with the scheduled rollout until this is resolved.\n\nLet me know once you've run a trace and profiled the nodes so we can finalize the optimization plan.\n\nBest,\nSarah",
